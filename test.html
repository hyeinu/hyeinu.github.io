      <h2>What D R I V E S me</h2>
      <p>I think the biggest influence to developing an interest in computers came from my father. 
      I remember, when I was about nine, my father encouraging me to play around on his computer and he has encouraged my involvement ever since,
      I never realized how fortunate it was to be exposed early on to the wonders of technology.
      This exposure, has in many ways shaped my world-view to what it is currently.</p>
      <p>
      I believe technology is here to help facilitate the connection between people.
      It is our duty to realize the potential and keep pushing the boundaries of technology. 
      The idea of this is rather a grand notion but I've seen some of the most wonderful things happen when people come together and work towards a worthwhile cause.
      Especially in this political, social, and economic climate of fear and mistrust I truely believe that by using technology in a responsible way we can influence the current enviroment to change towards a better future.
      </p>
      <p>One of the first steps of bringing about such change is to modify the current face of professionals in this field; to be more representative of the overall population.
      "Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different occupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the social sciences (58%) and biological and medical sciences (48%)
      and relatively low shares in engineering (13%) and computer and mathematical sciences (25%)" (<a href="https://ngcproject.org/statistics" class="accentColor"> source </a>).
      Women constituted around 10% of the medical professionals in the 1970s but now after 50 years women represent half of the current workforce (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/12/more-women-are-doctors-and-lawyers-than-ever-but-progress-is-stalling/266115/" class="accentColor"> source </a>).
      With information being easier to diseminate there is no reason why we shouldn't strive to see the same growth in a shorter amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>Living in Maryland, I am fortunate enough to have the opportunity to drive down to Washington D.C whenever I feel like.
      So I decided to do just that one afternoon after finding the WomenWhoCode D.C meetup page!
      I did not know what to expect and yes I was a little nervous because I have never been to such a meetup event. Silly thoughts ran through my head like 'what if they don't like me?' and 'oh goodness I hope I don't sweat too much!'.
      Staring at the sign that read "WWC meeting on the 3rd floor" I was just a bit overwhelmed that this was essentially the first step in joining a new community.
      With that realization the moment passes and I made my way upstairs.</p>
      
      <p>Life is about making choices and living with the results; and I am glad I made the choice to attend that meeting.
      Everyone was just so welcoming and no one seemed to mind that I was the 'new person' asking a ton of questions.
      Before that day I still had some reservations about leaping into such a huge decision like attending a bootcamp.
      It was such a relief to find that many of the women there had attended one themselves and as one person put it "survived"!
      I went away that day encouraged that I was making the right choice.</p>
