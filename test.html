      <h2>What D R I V E S me</h2>
      <p>I think the biggest influence to developing my interest in computers came from my father. 
      I remember, when I was about nine, my father encouraging me to play around on his computer and he has encouraged my involvement ever since,
      I never realized how fortunate it was to be exposed early on to the wonders of technology.
      This exposure, has in many ways shaped my world-view to what it is currently.</p>
      <p>
      I believe technology is here to help facilitate the connection between people.
      It is our duty to realize the potential and keep pushing the boundaries of technology. 
      The idea of this is rather a grand notion but I've seen some of the most wonderful things happen when people come together and work towards a worthwhile cause.
      Especially in this political, social, and economic climate of fear and mistrust I truely believe that by using technology in a responsible way we can influence the current enviroment to change towards a better future.
