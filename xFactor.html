      <h2>X Factor- Do I have what it takes?</h2>
      <p>At my previous job I was fortunate enough to be put into situations that made me face my fears and grow as an individual.
      There are just so many lessons I learned during that period of my life which have benefited me.
      </p><p>But in my opinion the three most important skills I honed were the following:</p>
      <h3 class="accentColor">1. Task Management</h3>
      <p>With any task I find myself attempting I always try to apply these five steps -
      <ul><li>Plan - always develop a clear Point A, Point B, and how to get between those two points.</li>
      <li>Prepare - proper preparation reduces the chances of complications.</li>
      <li>Prioritize - every task has multiple parts to it, but it is important to recognize which parts contribute most to the optimal progression of the task.</li>
      <li>Problem Solve - even with proper preparation there will always be problems. 
      When a problem occurs it is important to stay calm and to try and figure a solution.</li>
      <li>Progress - at the end of any day there needs to be progress towards a conclusion.</li>
      </ul></p>
      
      <h3 class="accentColor">2. Organization</h3>
      <p>I would not be able to accomplish any task with just those five steps, in order for success I need to be organized. 
      I have been accused of having an obsessive compulsive disorder; however, it is simply that I find organization plays a key role in my ability to assign myself tasks and preforming those tasks.</p>
      
      <h3 class="accentColor">3. Communication</h3>
      <p>I have never had a problem with talking; but holding a casual conversation and imparting my thoughts & ideas are two very different skills.
      While working internationally with people whose primary language was not English it was important that I learned how to clearly express myself in order to accomplish my assignment.
      Likewise being able to accurately convey my vision is beneficial in this field.
