      <h2>X Factor</h2>
      <p>At my previous job I was fortunate enough to be put into situations to made me face my fears and grow as an individual.
      There are just so many lessons I learned during that period of my life which have benefited me in the long-term.
      But in my opinion the three most important skills I honed were the following:</p>
      <h3 class="accentColor">1. Dealing with a task</h3>
      <p>With any task I find myself attempting I always try to remember these five steps -
      <li>Plan - always develop a clear Point A, Point B, and how to get between those two points.</li>
      <li>Prepare - proper preparation reduces the chances of complications</li>
      <li>Prioritize - every task has multiple parts to it, but it is important to recognize which parts contribute most to the optimal progression of the task.</li>
      <li>Problem Solve - even with proper preparation there will always be problems. 
      When a problem occurs it is important to remember the world is not ending and to try and figure a way out.</li>
      <li>Progress - at the end of any day there needs to be progress to eventually complete a task.</li></p>
      <h3 class="accentColor">2. Organization</h3>
      <p>The five steps I listed above means nothing without organzation. Organization plays a key role in my ability to assign myself tasks and getting those tasks done.</p>
      <h3 class="accentColor">3. Communication</h3>
      <p>I have never had a problem with talking but holding a casual conversation and imparting my thoughts and ideas are two very different skills.
      And I believe that being able to express oneself in such a manner is helpful to an individual in this field.</p>
