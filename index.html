      <h2>What DRIVES me</h2>
      <p>I think the biggest influence to developing an interest in computers came from my father. 
      I remember, when I was about nine, my father encouraging me to play around on his computer and he has encouraged my involvement ever since,
      I never realized how fortunate it was to have an early exposure to technology and how much it's shaped my current world views.</p>
      <p>
      I believe one of the greatest uses of technology is to help facilitate the connection between people.
      It is our duty to realize the potential and to keep pushing the boundaries. 
      The idea of this is rather a grand notion but I've seen some of the most wonderful things happen when people come together and work towards a worthwhile cause.
      Especially in this political, social, and economic climate of fear and mistrust I truly believe that by using technology in a responsible way we can influence a change in the current environment.
      </p>
      <p>One of the first steps of bringing about such change is to modify the current face of professionals in this field; to be more representative of the overall population.
      "Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different occupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the social sciences (58%) and biological and medical sciences (48%)
      and relatively low shares in engineering (13%) and computer and mathematical sciences (25%)" (<a href="https://ngcproject.org/statistics" class="accentColor"> source </a>).
      Women constituted around 10% of the medical professionals in the 1970s but now after 50 years women represent half of the current workforce (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/12/more-women-are-doctors-and-lawyers-than-ever-but-progress-is-stalling/266115/" class="accentColor"> source </a>).
      With information being easier to disseminate we should strive to see the same growth in a shorter amount of time!
      </p>
      <p>Living in Maryland, I am fortunate enough to have the opportunity to drive down to Washington D.C whenever I feel like.
      So I decided to do just that one afternoon after finding the WomenWhoCode D.C meetup page!
      I did not know what to expect and yes I was a little nervous because I have never been to such a meetup event. Silly thoughts ran through my head like 'what if they don't like me?' and 'oh goodness I hope I don't sweat too much!'.
      Staring at the sign that read "WWC meeting on the 3rd floor" I was just a bit overwhelmed that this maybe my first official step towards my future goals.
      The moment passes and I made my way upstairs.</p>
      
      <p>Life is about making choices and living with the results; and I am glad I made the choice to attend that meeting.
      Everyone was just so welcoming and no one seemed to mind that I was the 'new person' asking a ton of questions.
      I am glad such an organization exists to help connect women who are interested in programming.
      Before that day I still had some reservations about leaping into such a huge decision like attending a bootcamp.
      But it was such a relief to find that many of the women were bootcamp alumni and were more than happy to share their experiences.
      I went away that day encouraged that I was making the right decision.</p>
