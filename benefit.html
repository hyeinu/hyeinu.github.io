      <h2>How this program will benefit me</h2>
      <p>The thing that draws me the the most to Codinghouse is this sense of fostering an immersive learning enviroment.
      After my first interview with Nick, I really felt like this program would help allow me to take in the presented material. 
      Being with others who are also working towards a common goal is very helpful. I also look forward to meeting new people and ideas in this field.
      </p>
      <p>The fact that help and guidance is always readily avaliable is a huge bonus! I know that I learn best through application and sometimes it is just easier to sit down and talk through a concept with someone else.</p>
      
      <p>But the thing I hope to get most out of attending this program is the ability to integrate new technology and information with my current knowledge to improve my skills and approach to working.</p>
      
      <p class="accentColor">Again thank you for your time and consideration!</p>
