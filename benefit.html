      <h2>How this program will benefit me</h2>
      <p>Before committing to attending Codinghouse I did some reasearch on the other programs that are avaliable.
      The thing that I liked the most is this sense of fostering an immersive learning enviroment.
      After speaking with Nick at my first interview I really felt like this program would help allow me to take in the material. Being with others working towards a common goal is also very helpful.
      </p>
      <p>The thing I hope to get most out of attending this program is the ability to integrate new technology and information with my current knowledge to improve my skills and approach to working.</p>
      <p>The fact that help and guidance is always readily avaliable is a huge bonus! I learn best through application and sometimes it is just easier to hear someone sit down and explain the concept.</p>
